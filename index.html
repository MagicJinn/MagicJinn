                <h3>SDLS</h3>
                <p>Sunless Data Loading Simplified (SDLS) is a tool designed to streamline Sunless Sea modding. By
                    allowing modders to omit unused fields from .json files, SDLS simplifies mod creation and enhances
                    compatibility. It converts .sdls files to .json on startup, without modifying game files. Other
                    features include faster loading times and future support for merging mods and adding new content
                    without overwriting existing data. SDLS aims to help mod authors focus on the things that are really
                    important, writing excellent stories, without being bogged down by the complexity.</p>
                <p>SDLS is in active development, with 1.5 bringing massive performance improvements and documentation,
                    1.6 to 1.9 bringing quality of life features and performance improvements to the base game, and 2.0
                    set to introduce mod merging.</p>

                <h3>MrBeastify</h3>
                <p>MrBeastify is a browser extension inspired by <a href="https://mrbeastify.com"
                        target="_blank">MrBeastify.com</a> that adds MrBeast to every YouTube thumbnail. It's
                    feature-complete and no longer actively developed, but it's still maintained, adding extra images
                    each month, as well as fixing bugs caused by youtube frontend changes. It works on Chrome, Edge, and
                    Firefox, and was built for compatibility and optimized for speed and filesize.</p>

                <h3>Minor Sunless Sea Mods</h3>
                <ul class="mod-list">
                    <li><strong>SeaCull</strong> - A performance optimization mod for Sunless Sea that significantly improves game
                        performance through tile culling and frame rate optimizations, achieving performance gains of
                        40-70%. By dynamically managing the loading of sea tiles based on player distance, it reduces
                        unnecessary resource usage and improves overall game responsiveness. The mod also addresses several
                        technical issues in the base game, including the sea animation being tied to framerate and various
                        quirks with VSync and TargetFPS settings. Feature-complete.</li>
                    <li><strong>OriginalMainMenu</strong> - Restores the original Sunless Sea main menu background and
                        title card when Zubmariner is installed. Simple and easy to configure. Feature-complete.</li>
                    <li><strong>CorrespondentFix</strong> - Improves the Correspondent legacy by removing discovery data
                        from dead characters' charts while preserving layout and fog state. Fixes the original
                        "noob-trap" and makes the legacy actually useful. Feature-complete.</li>
                    <li><strong>AllShipsAllSlots</strong> - A lightweight (10KB) mod that adds both Forward and AFT
                        weapon slots to every ship in Sunless Sea. Features user-friendly configuration and
                        compatibility with vanilla and modded ships across all game versions (Steam, Epic, GOG). Serves
                        as a more efficient replacement for the original "Aft Slots for ALL" mod. Feature-complete.</li>
                    <li><strong>Legacy Yacht</strong> - A story mod that makes the massively outclassed Steam Yacht
                        inheritable so it's less terrible. Feature-complete.</li>

                <h3>Better Pet Teleporting</h3>
                <p>Better Pet Teleporting is a Minecraft mod that vastly improves pet teleportation logic so you don't
                    lose them. It supports all pets across all dimensions, ensuring your pets can always find you, even
                    in unloaded chunks or when crossing dimensions. It has automatic support for mods (as long as they
                    inherit the <code>EntityTameable</code> class) and randomized teleportation to prevent entity
                    cramming. Feature-complete.</p>

                <h3>Beacon Aura</h3>
                <p>Beacon Aura improves beacons by allowing you to <em>soak</em> in the beacon's effects while within
                    its range, extending their duration, to be enjoyed after you leave their radius. The strength of the
                    effect buildup and the maximum duration are determined by the beacon's level. The mod also increases
                    the beacon's range by default, as well as allowing you to configure it for yourself.

                <h3>The Block Keeps Ticking</h3>
                <p>The Block Keeps Ticking is a complete rewrite of Alive World (which is a fork of Presence Not
                    Required) that allows blocks and entities to continue progressing in unloaded chunks, so your farms,
                    furnaces, and passive mobs keep growing and working even when you're far away. The mod supports
                    block entities (furnaces, campfires, brewing stands), crops and stems, nether wart, cocoa beans,
                    tree saplings, growing plants (kelp, bamboo, sugar cane, cactus), and dried ghast and sniffer eggs.
                    Features include time modes (world time or real time progression), lazy tax settings to slow down
                    simulation, and per-object configuration to enable or disable simulation for specific blocks and
                    entities individually.</p>

                <h3>Quantum Things</h3>
                <p></p>Quantum Things is a 1.12.2 continuation of Lumien231's Random Things, a mod that adds a diverse
                collection of utility items, blocks, and gameplay enhancements. The goal of Quantum Things is to provide
                continued support for Random Things, including new features, bug and crash fixes, and compatibility with
                other mods, while staying true to the original design goal and intent of the mod.</p>
                <p>Quantum Things introduces extensive configurability through an in-game config menu, allowing players
                    to customize various aspects of the mod including plant and loot generation chances, Nature Core
                    behavior, disabling the Spectre Dimension, and adding new or disabling existing Divining Rods, with
                    over 100 new Divining Rods added by default. It also reintroduces several features from earlier
                    versions of Random Things, such as Spectre Armor and Biome Painter.</p>
                <p>Beyond new features, Quantum Things addresses numerous critical bugs and performance issues from the
                    original mod, including item duplication exploits, game freezes, various crash fixes, and
                    significant performance optimizations for systems like the Spectre Illuminator and Potion Vaporizer.
                    The mod maintains full compatibility with the original Random Things while providing a more stable
                    and configurable experience.</p>

                    <li><strong>Portalfarm Despawn Fix</strong> - A micro-mod for Fabric that fixes a common issue where
                        mobs transported through nether portals on multiplayer servers would immediately despawn when
                        there are players in the destination dimension. This mod prevents mobs from despawning in portal
                        farms by setting an upper bound to the despawning check. It is named this because it fixes a
                        mechanic most commonly seen when using portal based farms. Feature-complete.</li>
