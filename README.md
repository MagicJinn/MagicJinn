### Game Developer | Programmer | Game Modder

Aspiring game developer, basically a software dev, technically a webdev. Creator of **MrBeastify**, **SDLS**, and **Block-Sponsor-Comments**. I'm an aspiring full-time game developer, and I make game mods and browser extensions in my free time. 1.5 year game development school dropout because it was terrible. Check out the games I made on my [Itch.io](https://magicjinn.itch.io/). I am also a YouTube content creator.

## SDLS

Sunless Data Loading Simplified (SDLS) is a tool designed to streamline Sunless Sea modding. By allowing modders to omit unused fields from .json files, SDLS simplifies mod creation and enhances compatibility. It converts .sdls files to .json on startup, without modifying game files. Other features include faster loading times and future support for merging mods and adding new content without overwriting existing data. SDLS aims to help mod authors focus on the things that are really important, writing excellent stories, without being bogged down by the complexity.

SDLS is in active development, with 1.5 bringing massive performance improvements and documentation, 1.6 and 1.7 bringing quality of life features and performance improvements to the base game, and 2.0 set to introduce mod merging.

## Block Sponsor Comments

Block Sponsor Comments is a browser extension that removes sponsors from YouTube video descriptions and comments using simple string matching. The extension is feature-complete but still receives updates as I add new strings to the blocklist.

**Technologies: Browser Extensions**

## MrBeastify

MrBeastify is a browser extension inspired by [MrBeastify.com](https://mrbeastify.com) that adds MrBeast to every YouTube thumbnail. Itâ€™s in its final state and no longer actively developed, but it's still maintained, adding extra images each month, as well as fixing bugs caused by youtube frontend changes. It works on Chrome, Edge, and Firefox, and was built for compatibility and optimized for speed and filesize.

## Minor Sunless Sea Mods

- **CorrespondentFix** - Improves the Correspondent legacy by removing discovery data from dead characters' charts while preserving layout and fog state. Fixes the original "noob-trap" and makes the legacy actually useful. Built with C# Net3.5, BepInEx, and Unity. Feature-complete and archived.
- **AllShipsAllSlots** - A lightweight (10KB) mod that adds both Forward and AFT weapon slots to every ship in Sunless Sea. Features user-friendly configuration and compatibility with vanilla and modded ships across all game versions (Steam, Epic, GOG). Serves as a more efficient replacement for the original "Aft Slots for ALL" mod. Feature-complete and archived.
- **Legacy Yacht** - A story mod that makes the massively outclassed Steam Yacht inheritable so it's less terrible.

## Support Me

I have both Patreon, and a Ko-fi. Ko-fi lends itself more to one-time donations, but also supports a subscription model, and doesn't take a commission. If you are more comfortable with Patreon, that option is of course still available.
